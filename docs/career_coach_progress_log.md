# Career Coach AI - Progress Log

## Phase 1 Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully working with minor refinements needed

### What We Built
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Complete `career-coach-ai/` setup with UV
- ✅ **Dependencies**: OpenAI Agents SDK, Gradio, nest_asyncio successfully installed
- ✅ **Document Processing**: `retrieve_context` tool loads and searches resume, LinkedIn, summary
- ✅ **CareerCoach Agent**: Using OpenAI Agents SDK with personalized system prompt
- ✅ **Gradio Interface**: Working chat interface at `http://127.0.0.1:7861`
- ✅ **Event Loop Fix**: Applied `nest_asyncio` solution to resolve "AnyIO worker thread" error

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: OpenAI Agents SDK (`openai-agents` package)
- **Core Pattern**: Agent with function_tool for document retrieval
- **UI**: Gradio ChatInterface
- **Data**: Simple text chunking and keyword search
- **Key Fix**: `nest_asyncio.apply()` for Gradio/Agents SDK compatibility

### Testing Results
- ✅ Agent creation and basic interactions work
- ✅ Context retrieval from professional documents successful
- ✅ Coach responds with personalized "you" perspective
- ✅ No serious hallucinations detected
- ✅ Interface stable and responsive

### Issues Identified for Refinement

#### 1. Tone & Style Issues
- **Too verbose**: Responses are longer than needed
- **Too dry/formal**: Lacks conversational, engaging tone
- **Needs warmth**: Should feel more like human coach interaction

#### 2. Technical Expertise Boundaries  
- **Over-technical**: Agent gets too deep into tech details (Agentic AI, Agile)
- **Unrealistic expertise**: Real coaches don't know cutting-edge technical implementations  
- **Should focus on**: Career strategy, not technical implementation details

#### 3. Minor Fact Accuracy
- **Minor inaccuracies**: Some details were wrong but not severe hallucinations
- **Could improve**: Source citation and fact verification

## Next Steps - Phase 1.1 (Quick Polish)

### Immediate Refinements Needed

#### A. System Prompt Improvements
1. **Tone Adjustments**:
   - More conversational, less formal
   - Shorter, punchier responses
   - Warmer, more encouraging language

2. **Expertise Boundaries**:
   - Focus on career strategy over technical details
   - Avoid deep technical discussions unless directly relevant to career decisions
   - Stay in "career coach" role, not "technical expert" role

3. **Response Structure**:
   - Lead with key insight
   - Provide 2-3 specific actionable steps
   - End with clarifying question if needed

#### B. Testing & Iteration Plan
1. **Create test scenarios**:
   - Resume review requests
   - Interview preparation 
   - Career transition guidance
   - Salary negotiation advice

2. **Iterate system prompt**:
   - Test each change with real queries
   - Measure verbosity and technical depth
   - Refine until tone feels natural

3. **Validate improvements**:
   - Ensure context retrieval still works well
   - Confirm no increase in hallucinations
   - Check that coaching advice remains sound

### Alternative Next Steps (Future Consideration)

#### Option B: Phase 1.5 - Evaluator Pattern
- Implement response quality evaluation
- Add systematic feedback loop
- Use evaluation to guide improvements

#### Option C: Phase 2 - Job Analysis
- Build JobAnalysisAgent for job posting analysis
- Integrate existing job_match.py models
- Add job discovery and matching capabilities

## Session End Notes

- **Interface Location**: `http://127.0.0.1:7861` (test_app_fixed.py running)
- **Key Success**: Event loop issue completely resolved with nest_asyncio
- **Ready for**: Phase 1.1 refinements focusing on tone and boundaries
- **Priority**: Make the coach feel more human and less robotic

**Next Session Goals:**
1. Refine system prompt for better tone and coaching boundaries  
2. Test iterations with real coaching scenarios
3. Achieve natural, engaging coaching conversations
4. Prepare for Phase 2 planning once coaching experience feels right
